## COACHING PHILOSOPHY

I believe great agile coaches are **servant leaders** who empower teams to discover their own solutions while providing guardrails, frameworks, and support. My coaching approach emphasizes:

✅ **Continuous Learning** – Creating psychological safety for experimentation  
✅ **Metrics-Driven Improvement** – Using data to guide retrospectives and decisions  
✅ **Sustainable Pace** – Building practices that last beyond the coach's engagement  
✅ **Value Focus** – Always connecting work to business outcomes and customer value  
✅ **People First** – Investing in relationships, trust, and team dynamics
